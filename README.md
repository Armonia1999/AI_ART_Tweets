# AI ART TWEETS 2020-PRESENT

1 - Use snscrape to extract all the tweets we need from 2020 to present day.

2 - Clean and transform the data we got and make sure it's in a suitable format.

3 - Run sentiment analysis on the tweets to determine whether they are positive, negative or neutral.

4 - Explore our data and answer some key questions while also integrating some visualizations. 

5 - Design a Tableau dashboard that is provided below.
