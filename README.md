# AI ART TWEETS 2020-PRESENT

In this project we used snscrape to scrape relevant tweets about: Midjourney, NightCafe, Dall E-2 and stable diffusion. Afterwards we cleaned all the data we gathered and made sure it's in the format we need it to be. Then, used roBERTa to run sentiment analysis on the tweets to determine whether they have a positive, negative or a neutral feel to it. Also, explore our data and visualize it as we are answering some of our questions and lastely design a Tableau dashboard that is provided below.
